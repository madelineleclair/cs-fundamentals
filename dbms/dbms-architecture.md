### Notes
- 3 levels to DBMS
  1. External level/view level
  2. Conceptual level/logical level
  3. Internal level/storage level

  **External level**
  - Describes the part of the database that is relevant to each user

  **Conceptual level**
  - Describes what data is stored in the database and relationship among the data
    - All entities, attributes, and their relationship
    - Constraints on the data
    - Security and integrity

  **Internal level**
  - Physical representation of the database
  - Describes how the data is stored in the database, the data structures, and file organizations

- DBMS can be single tier or multi tier
- A tier architecture divides the whole system into related but independent modules

**1 tier architecture**
- Clients communicate with file system

**2 tier architecture**
- In this architecture, the clients communicates directly with the database server

**3 tier architecture**
- This is the most used for web based applications
- The client tier, communicates with the application server, the application server then communicates with the database server
