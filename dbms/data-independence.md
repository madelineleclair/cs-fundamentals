- Database systems are designed in multilayer
- Database system stores data about data, known as meta data
- Two types of data independence:
  1. Logical data independence
  2. Physical data independence
- A schema is a description of your database

**Logical data independence**
- Contains a logical schema. Also called conceptual schema.
- Logical data independence stores information about how data is managed inside
- Has the ability to change the logical schema without changing the external or application program

**Physical data independence**
- Contains a physical schema. Also called internal schema
- Ability to change the physical data without changing the logical data or external schema(logical schema)
- Change in internal schema such as different file organization, storage devices, indexing strategy
