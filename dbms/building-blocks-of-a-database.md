- Advantages of using a database:
  1. Data independence
  2. Access data efficiently
  3. Data integrity and security
  4. Data administration
    - User must have proper permissions to modify data
  5. Concurrent access and crash recovery
  6. Reduce application development time


- Disadvantages of using a database:
  1. Extra overhead cost
    - High investment in hardware, software, and training
  2. Cost of defining and processing data
